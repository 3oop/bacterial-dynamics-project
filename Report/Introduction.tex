
	Antibiotic resistance constitutes a critical global health threat, with World Health Organization projections indicating potential annual mortality in the millions by 2050 if current trends persist. This project develops a mathematical framework for modeling bacterial population dynamics within the human body, specifically examining the tripartite interaction between pathogenic bacteria, host immune response, and antibiotic interventions. 
	
	\subsection{Problem Context}
	Traditional models of bacterial dynamics exhibit a significant limitation: they typically isolate either antibiotic effects \textit{or} immune response mechanisms. This fragmentation neglects the synergistic reality where:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB)} employ survival mechanisms including target-site modification and plasmid-mediated resistance gene transfer
		\item \textbf{Non-resistant bacteria} compete for resources while responding differently to selective pressures
		\item \textbf{Immune effectors} dynamically interact with both bacterial subpopulations
		\item \textbf{Antibiotics} simultaneously impose selective pressure while modulating immune activity
	\end{enumerate}
	The clinical urgency is underscored by resistance drivers such as antibiotic overuse (e.g., inappropriate viral infection treatment), premature therapy discontinuation, and incorrect dosingâ€”all contributing to evolutionary selection favoring resistant strains.
	
	\subsection{Modeling Imperatives}
	Treatment complexity escalates dramatically with resistance emergence due to:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Diminished therapeutic options with higher toxicity profiles
		\item Immune function degradation during severe infections
		\item \textbf{Selective pressure} phenomena where indiscriminate antibiotic use eliminates susceptible bacteria while creating ecological niches for ARB expansion
	\end{itemize}
	Epidemiological evidence suggests that modest reductions (e.g., 10\%) in unnecessary antibiotic usage could significantly curb resistance propagation. However, predicting intervention outcomes requires sophisticated modeling accounting for:
	\begin{equation*}
		\underbrace{\text{Bacterial growth kinetics}}_\text{Competition} + \underbrace{\text{Resistance transmission}}_\text{Horizontal transfer} + \underbrace{\text{Immune recruitment}}_\text{Nonlinear dynamics}
	\end{equation*}
	
	\subsection{Proposed Framework}
	Our novel dynamical system addresses existing gaps by concurrently integrating:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Dual bacterial subpopulations (resistant vs. susceptible)
		\item Adaptive immune response dynamics
		\item Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic antibiotic profiles
	\end{itemize}
	This tripartite model enables quantitative investigation of:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Equilibrium conditions governing pathogen clearance
		\item Resistance dominance thresholds
		\item Chronic infection persistence criteria
	\end{itemize}
	Through numerical analysis and computational implementation, we examine critical scenarios including:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Optimal dosing windows minimizing resistance selection
		\item Immune augmentation strategies complementing antibiotics
		\item Failure modes under subtherapeutic drug concentrations
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Structural Overview}
	This paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 formalizes key biological mechanisms; Section 3 develops the governing equations; Section 4 analyzes equilibrium states; Section 5 presents numerical simulations; and Section 6 details the open-source implementation. Our integrated approach provides a critical tool for simulating combination therapies and optimizing antimicrobial stewardship policies.
