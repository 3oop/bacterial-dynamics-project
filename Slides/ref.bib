abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of interactions between antibiotic-resistant bacteria, the immune response, and the presence of antibiotics is crucial for developing effective strategies to combat antibiotic resistance. In this work, we introduce an innovative mathematical model that delves into the complex dynamics between bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics, the immune system, and the administration of antibiotic treatment. Through qualitative analysis, four distinct stable equilibria have been identified, each representing distinct biological scenarios, providing valuable insights for combating antibiotic resistance.}

abstract = {The human gut microbiome plays an important part in human health. The complexity of the microbiome makes it difficult to determine the detailed metabolic functions and cross-talk occurs between the individual species. In silico systems biology studies of the microbiome can help to identify metabolite exchanges among gut microbes. Constraint-based reconstruction and analysis methods use biochemically accurate genome-scale metabolic networks of microorganisms to simulate metabolism between species in a given microbiome and help generate novel hypotheses on microbial interactions. Here, we review metabolic modeling studies that have investigated metabolic functions of the gut microbiome.}

abstract = {Vast communities of microorganisms inhabit the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals. Understanding their initial development, fluctuations in composition, stability over long times, and responses to transient perturbations – in other words their dynamics – is important both for gaining basic insights into these ecosystems and for rationally manipulating them for therapeutic ends. Gut microbiome dynamics, however, remain poorly understood. We review here studies of gut microbiome dynamics in the presence and absence of external perturbations, noting especially the long timescales associated with overall stability and the short timescales associated with various underlying biological processes. Integrating these disparate timescales, we suggest, is an important goal for future work and is necessary for developing a predictive understanding of microbiome dynamics.}
