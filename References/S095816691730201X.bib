abstract = {The human gut microbiome plays an important part in human health. The complexity of the microbiome makes it difficult to determine the detailed metabolic functions and cross-talk occurs between the individual species. In silico systems biology studies of the microbiome can help to identify metabolite exchanges among gut microbes. Constraint-based reconstruction and analysis methods use biochemically accurate genome-scale metabolic networks of microorganisms to simulate metabolism between species in a given microbiome and help generate novel hypotheses on microbial interactions. Here, we review metabolic modeling studies that have investigated metabolic functions of the gut microbiome.}
