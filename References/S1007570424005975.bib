abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of interactions between antibiotic-resistant bacteria, the immune response, and the presence of antibiotics is crucial for developing effective strategies to combat antibiotic resistance. In this work, we introduce an innovative mathematical model that delves into the complex dynamics between bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics, the immune system, and the administration of antibiotic treatment. Through qualitative analysis, four distinct stable equilibria have been identified, each representing distinct biological scenarios, providing valuable insights for combating antibiotic resistance.}
